# Udita Healthtech - Innovative Healthcare Solutions

## Project Overview
Udita Healthtech is a web project designed to offer innovative healthcare solutions through a user-friendly interface. The application utilizes a modern design with responsive layouts, advanced animations, and interactive features, ensuring an engaging experience for users seeking healthcare services. It includes features like insurance reimbursement, flexible payment options, and various healthcare services.

## Installation
To set up the Udita Healthtech project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd udita-healthtech
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`**:
   The project mainly consists of HTML and CSS with no extensive backend setup required. For a simple view, open `index.html` in your web browser.

No dependencies need to be installed for displaying the site as it primarily uses external CDN links for styling (Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome, etc.). If you wish to further develop it, ensure you have a local server setup (like Live Server in VSCode or any similar option) for a better development experience.

## Usage
Once the project is set up:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Navigate through various sections including Home, Services, About, and Contact.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies, included via CDN links:

No additional library dependencies are found in `package.json` as the project does not require a Node.js environment.
